# Test_Database

This is a console application that imitates a database, but made in C. I'm still developing this project, taking each step as a lesson and having a lot of work to do.
Its purpose is to store the questions and generate N different tests with different questions or not, which can be selected in the test construction step. This app is user-friendly and i've been searching for almost every possible bug to fix them.
That's it, hope it would be useful.
